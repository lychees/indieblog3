Over a year ago, I set out to remake a game called Uncharted Waters 2. This month I reached a milestone, having extracted the tilesets and tilemap of its world map. As no one has detailed this, I’d like to contribute.

Much of my work is thanks to an old discussion on a Chinese forum, where a user called botx had outlined the general algorithm. My implementation, along with the relevant game files, are available on GitHub.

## At a Glance
The game splits the world map into three parts. The first part contains Europe and Africa, the second part Asia and Australia, and in the third part you will find the Americas. Each part consists of 30 * 45 blocks. 12 * 12 large tiles form a block, where each large tile in turn consists of 2 * 2 regular tiles.

Both the regular and large tiles are tilesets. The regular tiles are 16 * 16 pixels in size, of which there with 128 variations. The large tiles are 256 permutations of four regular tiles, and 32 * 32 pixels in size.

In short, the approach is to extract these two tilesets first. Then, move onto the blocks and figure out their indices. Map each index to a large tile, which in turn maps to 2 * 2 regular tiles. Afterwards, perform some extra processing for, among others, coastal tiles.

The raw data comes from the game files WORLDMAP.000, WORLDMAP.001, WORLDMAP.002, DATA1.010, DATA1.011 and DATA1.018. To get them, you need to uncompress WORLDMAP.LZW and DATA1.LZW using a tool such as "LS11 Archiver".

## Regular Tileset

The first half of DATA1.011 (16384 bytes) contains the 128 regular tiles. Each tile is 16 * 16 pixels in size, where each pixel uses 4 bits.

To extract all pixels, read 1024 bits at a time. Form the first pixel by combining bit 0, 256, 512 and 768 (left-to-right offsets). The second pixel by 1, 257, 513 and 769, and so on. Map these 4-bit values to RGB colors, drawing each tile left-to-right, top-to-bottom. The mapping varies based on time of day in-game; refer to my implementation for details.

Example: Bit 255 is 1, 511 is 0, 767 is 1 and 1023 is 1. The 4-bit binary number is 1011, giving us the value 11. This maps to #007161 and, being the 256th pixel, defines the bottom right of a tile.

Looking at the resulting tileset, there are obvious placeholders. There are also tiles used for ports and villages. If you take a longer look, you will notice all the terrains and tiles that appear to be coasts. Their significance will become clear soon.

## Large Tileset

DATA1.018 contains 256 large tiles that are 4 bytes each, giving a file size of 1024 bytes. The 4 bytes describe a permutation of 4 regular tiles, left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

Example: The 17th large tile consists of bytes 60, 61, 62 and 63, which have the values 116, 117, 118, 119. Mapping them to the regular tileset gives us the tiles that form how a port looks.

For the first 16 large tiles, however, the logic is different. Ignore DATA1.018 and express their index value in binary, where 0 maps to 0 (regular sea tile) and 1 to 65 (regular land tile).

Example: The 3rd large tile has an index value of 2, which is 0010 in binary. This gives us the values 0, 0, 65, 0, which is all sea except the bottom left tile.

Like regular tiles, there exists large tiles that are redundant and never used. Some of them even map to out of bounds regular tiles, for which I have replaced with transparent tiles.

## Blocks
WORLDMAP.000, as well as the two other world map parts, contain 30 * 45 blocks. A block is 12 * 12, where each index maps to a large tileset. In contrast to extracting regular and large tilesets, blocks are less straightforward.

The game describes each block using a template, together with data about how it differs from it. In total, there are six templates. To start extracting blocks, do the following:

Skip the first 2700 bytes.
Read 8 bits. The value of the three rightmost bits map to a template. The leftmost bit is 1 if the block, in the rare event, matches the template. Otherwise, proceed reading further.
Read 144 bits, and take note of when and where 1s occur as they state deviations from the template.
For each 1 encountered in the previous step, read 1 byte and use its value to correct the template.
Uncharted Waters 2 block templates
A block is based on one of these six templates
Contrived example:

The first 8 bits are 00000101. The three rightmost bits are 101, which refers to template number 5. The leftmost bit is 0, meaning there are differences.
Reading the next 144 bits, we find that the 13th and 131st bit are 1s.
We continue to read 2 bytes, and find that the first byte has a value of 16 and the second byte 17.
The resulting 12 * 12 block is all sea except two large tiles: a port at (0, 1) and a village at (11, 10).
Each block takes up a varying number of bytes — some take just a byte, while others 1 + 18 + the number of 1s within the 144 bits.

## Coastal Tiles

Replacing regular sea tiles, before and after
Having extracted all blocks, replace regular sea tiles that neighbor land to give coasts a less jagged look. To determine their replacements, iterate all regular sea tiles and do the following:

Form 8 bits by going counterclockwise through each adjacent tile. The first, leftmost bit comes from the top left tile. The obtained bit is 1 if the adjacent tile is land (non-water and non-coast), and 0 otherwise.
Using this 8-bit value, add 256 to it to get n. Read the nth byte of DATA1.010, of which its value replaces the regular sea tile.
Example:

Of a regular sea tile, all three adjacent tiles to the top are land while the rest are sea. This gives us the bits 10000011.
Adding 256 to the 8-bit value of 131, we get 387. As the 387th byte of DATA1.010 is 2, change the regular tile from 0 to 2.

## Deserts and Other Terrain
Uncharted Waters 2 world map deserts and other terrain
Three sequences of before and after: filling deserts, updating polar regions, and updating temperate zones
Of the few deserts in the world map, blocks only contain data about their edges. To fill their bodies, iterate regular desert tiles (89) and replace the right and bottom tiles to also be 89 if they are land tiles (65). Iterate left-to-right, top-to-bottom, including the newly replaced tiles. Afterwards, replace all desert tiles which border non-desert.

Blocks for the most part only express a single, default terrain, where regular land tiles are 65. Based on specific rules, apply corrections to them and coastal tiles. For the polar regions, which are the first and last block rows, add 16 to cover them by ice. For the temperate zones, rows 1 to 13 and 31 to 43, add 8. These corrections are only applied to default terrain: some land south of the Straight of Magellan, while in the last block row, is not covered by ice.

This section contains few details as I have not understood how the game applies them. If one has gotten this far, however, defining the mapping rules for desert "coasts" should not be an ardous undertaking.

As a side note, I made changes to a handful regular tiles to correct what appears to be minor oversights.

## Closing Thoughts
I found the approach Uncharted Waters 2 uses to compress data fascinating — utilizing two tilesets, storing blocks as template differences, and deriving coastal tiles and terrain. It’s funny how this contrasts what we can afford doing today, bundling entire web browsers with desktop applications.

Next up for my remake is making it possible to sail around the world. I foresee a couple of challenges:

How should the canvas be drawn? Its appearance changes often, as the color map varies with the in-game time. Drawing the entire map as a base, which I did for ports, is out of the question as this map is much larger.
Uncharted Waters 2 has AI fleets that sail around the world, and with a purpose. This means that coding their behavior will be needed. They need to be able to find their way to all ports, as well as hunt you down in the case of corsairs.
Investigation needs to be carried out to understand how the game simulates wind and ocean current. Are things like the Gulf Stream, westerlies and trade winds implemented in the game? Where and how do storms occur?
